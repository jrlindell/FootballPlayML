Econ 465 (Forecasting and Modeling) from Senior year at USAFA

Final Project was to create a machine learning model to predict what an offense was going to do (run: left, middle, right, 
pass: short, deep)

We used RStudio, and randomforest models, to predict the play the offense was going to run using data such as: team, quarter, down, distance. The data we scraped from my other repository of the OR 495  Sports Analytics class.


Using specific quarters and teams, we were able to predict play calls with 75% accuracy using a randomForest model
